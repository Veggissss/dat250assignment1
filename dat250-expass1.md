## DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1

### Installation
I had a few things installed before (and confirmed worked):
- Git
- Docker

I installed/updated:
- Gradle
- Updated IntelliJ to 2023 version

### Code refactor:
- Extracted unit conversion logic into a separate method
- Updated the unittests to test the new convertUnit method.
- Added method documentation/comment.

### Issues:
I had a bit of an issue with docker, when I tried to push my image it wouldn't let me. After I retagged the image it finally worked.

### Docker:
I created a docker image and uploaded it to dockerhub:
- Docker Repository: https://hub.docker.com/r/veggissss/dat250
