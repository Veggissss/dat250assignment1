## DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 4

### Code Repository: https://github.com/Veggissss/dat250expass5

I started out with creating a springboot project from https://start.spring.io/.
I selected the following dependencies that I was going to use in the tutorials: 

```[Spring Web, Thymeleaf, Spring Boot DevTools, Spring Data JPA, H2 Database]```

After importing all the dependencies I went through every tutorial.

I did not encounter any technical issues this time.
