## DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 7

### Code Repository: https://github.com/Veggissss/dat250expass7

### Experiment 1:
I tried to install RabbitMQ server locally on my machine, but I needed to install erlang for the installation to proceed.
After installing erlang I managed to install it successfully.

### Experiment 2-4:
I used gradle and added the RabbitMQ Java Client dependency.

Then I went through each RabbitMQ tutorial 1-3 and they were clear and easy to follow.

### Technical difficulties:
* Little to none
